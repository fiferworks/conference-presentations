# Orientation Slide:

# Hypothesis: Can SAR Reduce Populations of *P. fructiphilus*?
<!-- - Induce SAR *before* RRV infection -->
<!-- - acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), benzothiadiazole -->
<!-- - ASM used to protect plants from fungal infection -->
<!-- - Chitinase activity in roses [@Suo2001] -->
<!-- - Hypersensitive response and SAR interferes with the ability of eriophyoid mites to feed or grow on induced plants [@Bronner1991a; @Westphal1991; @Westphal1992]. -->

# Hypothesis: Will SAR Kill Predatory Mites?
<!-- # How does SAR-induction affect predators? -->
<!-- - Predatory mites may still be harmed via direct and indirect effects of SAR-induction [@Ataide2016, @Pappas2017] -->

# Results: Inducing SAR with Acibenzolar-S-Methyl seemed to work...

<!-- - 12 weeks, from August to October -->
<!-- - Griffin and Athens, GA -->
<!-- - low and high pest pressure  -->
<!-- - Plants inoculated with canes from nearby RRD-infected roses -->
<!-- - Inoculated 1st and 5th weeks of the experiment -->
<!-- - 48 Pink Double Knock Out® Roses 1 gallon buckets  -->
<!-- - acibenzolar-S-methyl, ASM (Actigard50WG)  -->
<!-- - Two rates: 50 \si{\milli\gram}/\si{\liter} (Half rate) and 100 \si{\milli\gram}/\si{\liter} (High rate) -->

<!-- - Goal: observe the effects of inducing Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) on *P. fructiphilus*  -->
<!-- - Griffin had two controls:  -->
<!-- - Kontos (Spirotetramat), label rate (negative control) -->
<!-- - Water (positive control) -->
<!-- - Athens had untreated roses and water as negative controls -->

<!-- - Subset of samples weekly -->
<!-- - Each rose plant has been sampled three times. -->
<!-- - Rose/rosebud cuttings ~10 cm -->
<!-- - Samples in 50 mL centrifuge tubes -->
<!-- - Washing methods of @Monfreda2007 -->
<!-- - Counted eriophyoid mites -->

<!-- # Results {#results-asm-ipm} -->
<!-- Combining predatory mites with a SAR-inducer was as effective as the miticide alone, and controlled herbivorous mite populations more than either SAR-induction or predatory mites alone -->

# Results: So 
<!-- # Design: IPM Trials -->
<!-- August to October simultaneously in Griffin, GA and Athens, GA. -->
<!-- The Athens site will be given 96 Pink Double Knock Out® Roses (Star Roses and Plants, West Grove, PA, USA), while Griffin will use 54 roses due to the smaller plot area available. Bare root roses will be planted 2 months before the trials begin to allow new flush to form. Rose planting media and environmental conditions will be the same as previously described. -->

<!-- # Treatments - IPM -->
<!-- - ASM (Actigard 50WG) and SP2700, (Ninja, SePro) -->
<!-- - *A. swirskii* 2 mini sachets with hooks sachets per rose -->
<!-- - ASM + *A. swirskii* -->
<!-- - Kontos - spirotetramat acaricide as a negative control  -->
<!-- - Water - a positive control  -->
<!-- - 12 weeks, mites applied on the 1st, 5th and 9th week -->
<!-- - Two blocks, 10 plots, 12 roses/plot w/buffer, six roses treated -->


<!-- # Data Collection: IPM -->
<!-- - Cuttings taken weekly from six treated roses -->
<!-- - Three flowers (buds if no flowers present)  -->
<!-- - ~18 flowers/buds per bottle for each plot -->
<!-- - Bottles with 95% EtOH -->
<!-- - Sieves to separate mites from the plant tissues. -->
<!-- - Plant tissues dried ~48 hrs at 50 &deg;C, weighed -->
<!-- - *A. swirskii* applied on the 1st, 5th and 9th week -->

<!-- # Treatments: IPM -->
<!-- - Water - Control -->
<!-- - Actigard - 100 mg/L -->
<!-- - Ninja - label rate -->
<!-- - Kontos - label rate -->
<!-- - *A. swirskii* (one sachet per rose treated) -->
<!-- - *A. swirskii* + Ninja (one sachet per rose treated, label rate) -->

<!-- # Discussion {#dis-asm-ipm} -->
<!-- Our results suggest that SAR-induced plant defenses have the potential to manage populations of *P. fructiphilus* and other herbivorous mites, especially when integrating SAR-induction with predatory mites. -->
