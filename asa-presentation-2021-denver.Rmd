# Management of herbivorous mites of rose with predatory mites and Systemic Acquired Resistance
Austin Fife, Gary Knox, Xavier Martini, Mathews Paret

# *Phyllocoptes fructiphilus* Keifer (Trombidiformes: Eriophyidae)

- Vector for Rose Rosette Virus (RRV)

- Possibility of introducing RRD from areas where the disease had become established, including the neighboring states of Georgia and Alabama [@Solo2020; @Solo2018].

# Phytoseids an option for control?
- Small species may be able to find and feed on *P. fructiphilus*
- *Amblyseius swirskii* Athias-Henriot (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) mites were attracted towards roses which were infected with RRD
- Too large!

- Low levels of MeSA from RRV-infected roses
- MeSA attractive to some many predatory mites

# MeSA and SAR
- MeSA increases when a plant is attacked by herbivores or pathogens, derivative of Salicylic Acid
- Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR), protects distant tissues
- Hypersensitive Response
- Enduring resistance
- Pathogen resistance: fungi, bacteria and viral pathogens

# SAR-induction
- Induce SAR *before* RRV infection
- acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), benzothiadiazole
- ASM used to protect plants from fungal infection
- Chitinase activity in roses [@Suo2001]
- Hypersensitive response and SAR interferes with the ability of eriophyoid mites to feed or grow on induced plants [@Bronner1991a; @Westphal1991; @Westphal1992].

# How does SAR-induction affect predators?
- Predatory mites may still be harmed via direct and indirect effects of SAR-induction [@Ataide2016, @Pappas2017]

# Design: ASM Trials
- 12 weeks, from August to October
- Griffin and Athens, GA
- low and high pest pressure 
- Plants inoculated with canes from nearby RRD-infected roses
- Inoculated 1st and 5th weeks of the experiment
- 48 Pink Double Knock Out® Roses 1 gallon buckets 

# Treatments: ASM
- acibenzolar-S-methyl, ASM (Actigard50WG) 
- Two rates: 50 \si{\milli\gram}/\si{\liter} (Half rate) and 100 \si{\milli\gram}/\si{\liter} (High rate)
- Goal: observe the effects of inducing Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) on *P. fructiphilus* 
- Griffin had two controls: 
- Kontos (Spirotetramat), label rate (negative control)
- Water (positive control)
- Athens had untreated roses and water as negative controls

# Data Collection: ASM
- Subset of samples weekly
- Each rose plant has been sampled three times.
- Rose/rosebud cuttings ~10 cm
- Samples in 50 mL centrifuge tubes
- Washing methods of @Monfreda2007
- Counted eriophyoid mites

# Design: IPM Trials
August to October simultaneously in Griffin, GA and Athens, GA.
The Athens site will be given 96 Pink Double Knock Out® Roses (Star Roses and Plants, West Grove, PA, USA), while Griffin will use 54 roses due to the smaller plot area available. Bare root roses will be planted 2 months before the trials begin to allow new flush to form. Rose planting media and environmental conditions will be the same as previously described.

# Treatments - IPM
- ASM (Actigard 50WG) and SP2700, (Ninja, SePro)
- *A. swirskii* 2 mini sachets with hooks sachets per rose
- ASM + *A. swirskii*
- Kontos - spirotetramat acaricide as a negative control 
- Water - a positive control 
- 12 weeks, mites applied on the 1st, 5th and 9th week
- Two blocks, 10 plots, 12 roses/plot w/buffer, six roses treated

## Results {#results-asm-ipm}
Combining predatory mites with a SAR-inducer was as effective as the miticide alone, and controlled herbivorous mite populations more than either SAR-induction or predatory mites alone

## Discussion {#dis-asm-ipm}
Our results suggest that SAR-induced plant defenses have the potential to manage populations of *P. fructiphilus* and other herbivorous mites, especially when integrating SAR-induction with predatory mites.
